# My Learning Journey 🚀

Hi there! 👋

I'm currently on a self-taught journey into full-stack web development. While I don’t have a polished public project to show just yet, I’ve been actively learning and experimenting with different technologies, and I’m excited to take my skills to the next level.

## 🛠️ Technologies I'm Learning:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Node.js, Express.js
- MySQL, MongoDB
- Git & GitHub
- Basic frontend/backend integration

## 📚 What I’ve Been Doing:
- Completing tutorials and online coding challenges
- Building small practice features (login forms, to-do lists, etc.)
- Debugging issues and helping classmates with code problems
- Exploring how full-stack apps are structured

 I’m ready to collaborate, learn from others, and build something meaningful!

Thanks for checking out my progress so far 🙌
